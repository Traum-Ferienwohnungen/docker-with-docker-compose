# Docker with docker-compose

This project provides a simple to use alternative to the
[docker/compose](hub.docker.com/r/docker/compose) image for a single use case.

Feel free to use it, but don't expect it to stay fresh or remain available.
I still have hope that docker will do something about https://github.com/docker-library/docker/issues/18.
